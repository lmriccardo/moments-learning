# First and Second-order moments Learning

FSML is the result of a project for the course *Automatic Verification Of Intelligent Systems* at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" A.A. 2022/2023. The first goal of this project is to create a simple Neural Network that is able to learn how to predict the *mean* and the *variance* from the fixed parameters of a time series model. The second objective is to experiment if it is also possible the inverse. A more detailed version that explain the main reasons and the entire procedure that I setted up to complete the project can be found in the PDF report `report.pdf` in the root folder. In this README I will just give to you a quick overview of the project and its technical details.
