FSML Package Documentation
==========================

FSML is the result of a project for the course *Automatic Verification Of Intelligent Systems* at the 
University of Rome "La Sapienza" A.A. 2022/2023. The first goal of this project is to create a simple 
Neural Network that is able to learn how to predict the *mean* and the *variance* from the fixed parameters 
of a time series model. The second objective is to experiment if it is also possible the inverse.
